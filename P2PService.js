/**
 * P2PService.js
 *
 * The P2PService class in the Blockcraft blockchain framework handles peer-to-peer (P2P) communications within
 * the blockchain network. It is responsible for node discovery, data synchronization, and maintaining the
 * decentralized nature of the blockchain.
 *
 * This class ensures that all nodes in the network stay updated with the latest blockchain state and facilitates
 * the propagation of new transactions and blocks. The P2PService class can be tailored to use different P2P
 * communication protocols and strategies, offering flexibility for various network topologies.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * const p2pService = new P2PService();
 * p2pService.setNetworkNode(networkNodeInstance);
 *
