## Getting Started 🛠️

Dive into the world of blockchain development with Blockcraft by following these setup instructions:

1. **Installation**

```bash
npm install github:chrisallenarmbruster/blockcraft
```

## Usage 🔍

Blockcraft is designed to empower developers with the flexibility to build customizable and efficient blockchain systems. At the core of Blockcraft's design is the separation of concerns, allowing developers to mix and match different components for consensus mechanisms, incentive models, data handling, and storage. This section will guide you through using these features to set up a comprehensive blockchain solution.

### The Blockchain Class 💾

The `Blockchain` class is the heart ❤️ of your blockchain application, orchestrating the interaction between various components. It is initialized with several key parameters that define its behavior:

- **Consensus Mechanism** 🤝: Determines how consensus is achieved on the blockchain. Blockcraft allows for the integration of various consensus mechanisms, enabling you to choose or develop one that best fits your application's requirements.

- **Incentive Model** 🏅: Defines the strategy for rewarding network participants. This modular approach lets you implement a custom incentive model that motivates participation in your blockchain network.

- **Data Handler** 📊: Manages the processing and storage of data within blocks. By customizing the data handler, you can tailor how data is treated, validated, and stored on your blockchain.

- **Storage Handler** 🗃️: Controls how blockchain data is persisted. Whether you're using file systems, databases, or other storage solutions, the storage handler ensures your blockchain data is securely saved and retrievable.

- **Configuration Object** ⚙️: A flexible configuration object allows you to fine-tune the settings and parameters of your blockchain, such as block size limits, transaction fees, and network protocols.

```javascript
const blockchain = new Blockchain({
  consensusMechanism: new ProofOfWorkConsensus(),
  incentiveModel: new StandardMiningReward(),
  dataHandler: new CustomDataHandler(),
  storageHandler: new FileStorageHandler(),
  config: { blockchainName: "my-blockcraft-blockchain" },
});
```

### The NetworkNode Class 🌍

For blockchain networks to function, nodes must communicate and synchronize with each other 🤝. The `NetworkNode` class encapsulates the network layer, integrating:

- **P2P Service** 🔄: Manages peer-to-peer communication between nodes, ensuring data is shared efficiently across the network without relying on a central server.
- **Web Service** 🌐: Provides an HTTP interface for your blockchain, allowing external applications and users to interact with the blockchain via web requests.

The `NetworkNode` class takes an instance of your `Blockchain` 💼, along with instances of the P2P service and Web service, fully encapsulating the networking functionality and allowing your blockchain to operate within a distributed network 🚀.

```javascript
const networkNode = new NetworkNode(
  blockchain,
  new P2PService(),
  new WebService()
);
```

### Example Included 📝

To help you get started, a simple example (see [example.js](./example.js)) is included that demonstrates how to set up a basic blockchain and dApp nodes to host it using Blockcraft. This example showcases the creation of a blockchain with a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, a standard mining reward incentive model, and file-based data and storage handlers. The example also demonstrates how to set up a network node to host the blockchain, allowing it to communicate with other nodes in a decentralized network.

### Flexibility and Customization 🔧

The separation of concerns within Blockcraft not only ensures cleaner code and easier maintenance but also grants unparalleled flexibility 🤸‍♂️. Developers can swap out consensus mechanisms 🔁, experiment with different incentive models, customize data handling logic, and choose their preferred method of data storage 🗃 without altering the core blockchain logic. The same is true for creating dApp nodes for hosting blockchains, allowing peer-to-peer services 🌐 and web interfaces to be switched. This design philosophy encourages innovation and experimentation 🚀, enabling the creation of a blockchain that perfectly fits each developer's unique requirements.

## Final Thoughts 🚀

Blockcraft's modular architecture is designed with the developer in mind 🧠, offering the building blocks 🏗️ to create, customize, and scale blockchain applications. By understanding and utilizing the core components of Blockcraft—`Blockchain` and `NetworkNode` classes, along with their associated services and handlers ✨, Blockcraft equips developers to construct blockchain solutions that are tailored 🛠️ to each application's needs.
