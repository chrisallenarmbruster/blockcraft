/**
 * Blockcraft: A Comprehensive Blockchain Toolkit
 *
 * Welcome to Blockcraft, a modular and extensible toolkit designed for building and exploring blockchain technologies.
 * This file serves as the main entry point to the Blockcraft package, exporting a suite of classes and utilities that
 * form the backbone of any blockchain application.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - `NetworkNode`: A core class representing a node in the blockchain network, facilitating network operations.
 * - `Blockchain`: A core class representing the blockchain itself, managing the chain and its operations.
 * - `Block`: The basic building block of the blockchain, containing data and links to other blocks.
 * - `P2PService`: Handles peer-to-peer communications within the blockchain network.
 * - `WebService`: Manages HTTP API communications for blockchain interaction.
 * - `ConsensusMechanism`: An abstract base class for blockchain consensus mechanisms.
 * - `ProofOfWorkConsensus`: An implementation of a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.
 * - `ProofOfWorkBlock`: Extends `Block` with proof-of-work functionality.
 * - `IncentiveModel`: An abstract base class for incentive models in a blockchain.
 * - `StandardMiningReward`: Implements a standard mining reward system.
 * - `DataHandler`: Manages data entries in the blockchain.
 * - `StorageHandler`: Handles the persistent storage of blockchain data.
 *
 * Installation:
 * To install Blockcraft directly from GitHub, use the following command:
 * ```
 * npm install https://github.com/chrisallenarmbruster/blockcraft.git
 * ```
 *
 * Usage:
 * To use any of these classes in your blockchain project, simply import them from the Blockcraft package.
 * Example:
 * ```
 * import { Blockchain, Block, NetworkNode } from 'blockcraft';
 * ```
 *
 * Dive into the fascinating world of blockchain with Blockcraft and build your decentralized applications with ease!
